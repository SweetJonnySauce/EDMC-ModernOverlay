      "LandingPad added aspect_x years ago to compensate for the original Windows-only EDMCOverlay.exe.",
      "That binary rendered into a fixed 1280x1024 virtual canvas, and the plugin's coordinates assumed it was being stretched to fit arbitrary screen sizes.",
      "",
      "By multiplying X by an extra factor derived from the monitor dimensions (calc_aspect_x), LandingPad tried to undo the horizontal stretch so the dodecagon stayed round.",
      "ModernOverlay already handles that scaling, so leaving aspect_x active doubles the correction and flattens the pad."
