Fonts
=====

The overlay bundles Source Sans 3 (Google Fonts) under the SIL Open Font
License 1.1 via `SourceSans3-Regular.ttf`. The license text is provided in
`SourceSans3-OFL.txt`.

If you prefer to override the HUD font, drop alternative font files in this
directory. For example, place `Eurocaps.ttf` alongside its own license file.
Any supplied font is loaded at runtime, with Source Sans 3 taking priority and
fallbacks cascading to other available fonts and finally the system default.
