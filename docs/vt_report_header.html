<h1>EDMC Modern Overlay VirusTotal Report</h1>
<p>Here you will find VirusTotal test results and links (click on the badges) for the VirusTotal scan of each
    release<br>
    asset. The EXE installer is not passing VirusScan results due to the release asset either being unsigned or
    because<br>
    it builds a python environment as part of the installation. These are known issues, but unlikely to change. The
    EXE<br>
    however is built entirely using Github Actions and you can click on the Workflow Run link to see the build logs.</p>
